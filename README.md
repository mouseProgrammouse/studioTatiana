## Design
  **Brief:** _Create a landing page for the small knitted studio in Ukraine. The studio specializes in producing clothes from wool yarn such as sweaters, cardigans, etc. Main customers are women aged 35 and above._
  
  **Multilingual:** The content of the site is translated into two languages (Russian and Ukrainian). Languages switching is stored in `cookies`.
  
  **Responsive:** The application is usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers and looks good at different screen sizes. CSS breakpoints are used for switching between designs.
  
  **Design Inspiration:**
  The main inspiration for this site came from studio works and sewing tools.
